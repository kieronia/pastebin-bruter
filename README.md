# pastebin-bruter
This is more of a demonstration project - as it's an 8 digit string it'll take a LONG LONG LONG LONG time although I'm sure it's possible as pastebin codes can be kept forever and it's a widely used site. If this gets some love I'll probably make it use proxies and make it multithreaded as opening multiple versions of this at once causes false valid links as it returns  "too many requests"  - can fix this pretty easily too but meh,anyways have fun and I hope you learn something from this!
